Introduction
============

*Portlets* are content objects which are managed in *Slots*. *Slots* can be
freely defined and placed anywhere within a HTML page.

Portlets are usual content objects, that means they can have arbitrary fields
and functionalities.

There are also some more advanced features like inheriting and blocking of
portlets.

django-portlets provides just a generic engine to manage portlets. You can
find a comprehensive implementation within `LFS`_.

Example
=======
django-portlets comes with a simple example application which shows how to use it.
